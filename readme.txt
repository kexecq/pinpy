    Downloading images from Pinterest is annoying.
    
    A slow and tedious way of downloading images is combing through the site's HTML to find the image url 
    which becomes even impossible when you want to download an entire board of "pins" (images).
    
    This program helps with that.

    How to use: python3 pinpy.py
    Very simple.
